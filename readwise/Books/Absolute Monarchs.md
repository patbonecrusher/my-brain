## Highlights
- Despite the fact that Greek was, even in Rome itself, the first language of Christianity (and would continue to be dominant in the liturgy until the middle of the fourth century) and that the first- and second-century popes in Rome were nearly all Greeks, none of them proved to be thinkers or theologians—or even administrators—of any real distinction. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=291))
- For the Christians, however, life under Commodus was a good deal easier than it had been under his father, to the point where a eunuch named Hyacinthus became the first and almost certainly the last man in history to combine the duties of controller of a three-hundred-strong harem and presbyter of the Christian Church. ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=312))
- Besides, Western churchmen lacked the insatiable intellectual curiosity of their Eastern brethren; ([Location 399](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=399))
- Siricius (384–399), had been the first to assume the title of “Pope,” giving it much of the significance that it bears today; ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=436))
- Gerbert of Aurillac, then Archbishop of Ravenna. The first Frenchman to become Supreme ([Location 1658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1658))
- Gerbert himself is generally credited with having first popularized Arabic numerals and the use of the astrolabe, together with that of the celestial and terrestrial globes, in the Christian West. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1665))
- but the result was chaos. There were now no fewer than three pretenders, all claiming to be the legitimate pope. Two of the three were practically worthless; Gratian, who now called himself Gregory VI, was at least a serious churchman and a pious reformer, even though he was unable to shake off rumors of simony. ([Location 1708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1708))
- Abbot Hugh of Cluny, under whose direction medieval monasticism reached its apogee; ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1738))
- Yet such was the sequence of events at Constantinople in the summer of 1054 which resulted in the lasting separation of the Eastern and Western churches. ([Location 1799](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1799))
- Byzantium: The Apogee, p. 321. ([Location 1824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1824))
- The last pope to be nominated by a German king, he was enthroned on April 13 under the name Victor II, ([Location 1832](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1832))
- The procedure governing papal elections had always been vague; it was theoretically based on a settlement, originated by the Emperor Lothair in 824 and renewed by Otto the Great in the following century, according to which the election was to be carried out by the entire clergy and nobility of Rome; the new pontiff, however, was to be consecrated only after he had taken an oath to the emperor. Such a decree, loose enough in its original conception and looser ([Location 1882](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1882))
- On April 13, 1059, Pope Nicholas held a synod at the Lateran, and there, in the presence of a hundred and thirteen bishops and with Hildebrand as always at his side, he promulgated the decree which, with one or two later amendments, continues to regulate papal elections to the present day. For the first time the responsibility for electing a new pope was placed squarely on the cardinals, effectively the senior clergy in Rome.2 Only after a pontiff had been elected was the assent of the rest of the clergy and people to be sought. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=1889))
- Hildebrand, or Hildeprand, was a common Lombard name. His father’s name, Bonizo, is an abbreviation of Bonipart, which seven centuries later we find again in the form of Buonaparte. Napoleon was also of Lombard stock. He and Hildebrand had much in common. ([Location 2113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2113))
- There must be the minimum of delay: the great army of the Crusade must be ready to march by the Feast of the Assumption, August 15, 1096. ([Location 2165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2165))
- the soldiers of Christ battered their way into Jerusalem, where they slaughtered all the Muslims in the city and burned all the Jews alive in the main synagogue. ([Location 2171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2171))
- It seems an unfortunate choice of metaphor, and it says much for the new pope’s gentleness and patience that he showed no resentment; but Bernard was, after all, his spiritual father, and in the months to come he was to need his old master as badly as he had ever needed him in his life—for he was now called upon to summon the Second Crusade. It ([Location 2485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2485))
- Louis asked nothing better. He was one of Nature’s pilgrims. Though still only twenty-four, he had about him an aura of joyless piety which made him look and seem far older than his years—and irritated to distraction his beautiful and high-spirited young wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. ([Location 2499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2499))
- Early in 1155, for the first time in the history of Christendom, the entire city of Rome was laid under an interdict. ([Location 2599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2599))
- but now at last Alexander ordained that the right to elect a new pope was to be restricted to the College of Cardinals, with a two-thirds majority required before any candidate could be elected. ([Location 2946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2946))
- Apart from the fact that since the pontificate of John Paul II the right to vote has been restricted to cardinals aged under eighty, virtually the same rules apply today. ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2947))
- It was agreed that the Crusade would be led by Frederick Barbarossa; he would be joined by Richard I, Coeur-de-Lion, ([Location 2971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=2971))
- No pope ever had a more elevated conception of his position than Innocent III; he was indeed the Vicar of Christ on Earth (a designation that first became current in his day), standing, as it were, halfway between God and man. ([Location 3054](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3054))
- He was less fortunate in giving his blessing to the Fourth Crusade. ([Location 3075](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3075))
- By a curious irony the year 1209, which marked the beginning of the Albigensian Crusade, also saw the establishment of the first of the two great mendicant orders, those of St. Francis of Assisi and St. Dominic, respectively. ([Location 3111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3111))
- 1216. Alas, the Fifth Crusade proved as ill starred as the Second, Third, and Fourth. ([Location 3229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3229))
- Damietta duly fell on November 5, 1219, but the war dragged on for nearly two more years and would have continued even longer had not the Crusading army been trapped by the Nile floods, from which it extricated itself only by surrender. ([Location 3235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3235))
- For the failure of the Fifth Crusade had served only to increase the pope’s determination to launch a Sixth, to be led by the emperor himself. Frederick remained markedly unenthusiastic, but there was now a further complication to be considered. ([Location 3245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3245))
- The pontificate of Gregory IX was completely overshadowed by his battle with the emperor. He did, however, make one significant contribution to canon law, publishing in 1234 what was known as the Liber Extra, the first complete collection of papal decretals, which was to remain the fundamental authority until the early twentieth century. ([Location 3388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3388))
- Even now they took their time: it was not till February 1288 that they elected, as a compromise, the first Franciscan pope, a former general of the order, Girolamo Masci. ([Location 3487](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3487))
- They took their time, deliberating for twenty-seven months before picking one of the most unsuitable men ever to occupy, however briefly, the papal throne. He was Pietro da Morrone, an eighty-five-year-old peasant who had lived for more than six decades as a hermit in the Abruzzi, and his only qualification was that once, while appearing briefly at the court of Gregory X, he had hung up his outer habit on a sunbeam. ([Location 3493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3493))
- No wonder that he lasted for just five months, then wisely announced his abdication—the only one in papal history. ([Location 3504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3504))
- Within three or four years of his accession, Boniface VIII was probably the most widely detested pope there had ever been. ([Location 3567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3567))
- Honorius was, incidentally, the last pope to have been married before his ordination. ([Location 3604](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3604))
- But a greater humiliation still was in store: the part Clement was forced to play in Philip’s plan for the elimination of the Knights Templar. ([Location 3652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3652))
- On Friday, October 13, 1307,2 the grand master of the Temple, Jacques de Molay, was arrested in Paris with sixty of his leading brethren. ([Location 3675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3675))
- Clement V is remembered today principally for being the first of the Avignon popes; the important thing to remember, however, is that there was at no time any official transference of the papal capital. ([Location 3708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3708))
- In all this vapid display, John was happy to take the lead. He it was who founded the vineyards of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, and a record has survived of the provisions laid in for the banquet he gave in November 1324 on the occasion of the marriage of his great-niece. ([Location 3764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=3764))
- Jan Hus was there in person, his security guaranteed—as he thought—by a letter of safe conduct from Sigismund, but he was arrested on the pope’s orders after only a preliminary hearing, handed ([Location 4191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4191))
- over to the king when he arrived just before Christmas, and—still at Constance—burnt at the stake on July 6, 1415. ([Location 4192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4192))
- All too soon came disaster: on Tuesday, May 29, 1453, after a fifty-five-day siege, the army of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II smashed down the walls of Constantinople and put an end to the Christian Empire of the East. ([Location 4416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4416))
- By Nicholas’s death he had spent 30,000 gold florins and had collected some twelve hundred volumes, the nucleus of today’s Vatican Library. ([Location 4441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4441))
- He restored the Hospital of Santo Spirito—still a hospital today—and the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitol. ([Location 4586](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4586))
- Columbus’s three ships, returning to Spain from the Caribbean in 1493, had brought with them the first cases of syphilis known to the Old World; through the agency of the Spanish mercenaries sent by Ferdinand and Isabella to support King Alfonso, the disease had quickly spread ([Location 4766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4766))
- In 1494, after protests by the Portuguese, the line was moved further westward by the Treaty of Tordesillas; this made it possible in 1500 for Portugal to claim Brazil and explains why Brazil remains Portuguese-speaking today. THE LAST FOUR years of Alexander’s pontificate were taken up largely with his and Cesare’s ambition to appropriate the Papal States and to turn them into a Borgia family fief. The program was mapped out and put into execution by Cesare, who by now utterly dominated his father. It involved the crushing of many of the great Roman families, above all the Orsini; it necessitated several assassinations, ([Location 4831](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4831))
- In fact, he lasted twenty-six days, one of the shortest pontificates in history. ([Location 4916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4916))
- Not since Leo IX—at Civitate in 1053—had a pope led his army personally in battle; Julius did so on several occasions, notably when, in January 1511, aged sixty-eight and wearing full armor, he personally trudged with his army through deep snowdrifts to capture Mirandola from the French. ([Location 4939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=4939))
- though it was he who had issued the fateful dispensation which authorized Henry VIII to marry Catherine of Aragon, the widow of his elder brother, Arthur. ([Location 5118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5118))
- Leo’s biographer Paolo Giovio saw his reign as a golden age. The city’s most powerful banker, Agostino Chigi, had erected a huge triumphal arch beneath which the procession passed, inscribed with the words ([Location 5173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5173))
- It was on October 31, 1517—just at the time when, in the aftermath of the Petrucci conspiracy, Pope Leo was appointing his thirty-one new cardinals—that Martin Luther nailed his notice to the church door at Wittenberg, ([Location 5208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5208))
- It was the last time in history that a pope was to crown an emperor; on that day the seven-hundred-year-old tradition, which had begun when Pope Leo III had laid the imperial crown on the head of Charlemagne, was brought to an end. ([Location 5468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5468))
- on July 11, 1533—when the king had forced Archbishop Thomas Cranmer to declare his marriage to Catherine null and void and had already married Anne Boleyn—he finally did. And Henry fought back. Defender of the Faith he may have been; but he now unhesitatingly broke with Rome and established the Church of England, placing himself at its head. ([Location 5478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5478))
- and a few years later he accorded a similar welcome to the rather older Ignatius Loyola, a Basque who had arrived with half a dozen like-minded colleagues from Spain, grouped together in what they called the Society of Jesus. In 1540 the pope issued a bull giving the Society his official approval. The Jesuits, with no distinctive dress for their order, no fixed headquarters, and no choral prayer, were bound together by two things only: strict discipline and unconditional obedience. As we shall see, they were to have a checkered history, but they were the spearhead of the Counter-Reformation. ([Location 5548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5548))
- He suspended the Council of Trent, replacing it with a commission of cardinals and theologians; he introduced the Index of Forbidden Books, including on it the complete works of Erasmus;8 he took a special delight in the Inquisition, never missing its weekly meeting; finally, he opened the most savage campaign in papal history against the Jews, to the point where, in the five short years of his pontificate, the Jewish population of Rome was halved. ([Location 5616](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5616))
- But it was under Paul IV that the Jews were first rounded up into a ghetto, forbidden to trade in any commodity except food and secondhand clothing, permitted only a single synagogue in each city—in Rome seven were demolished—compelled to speak only Italian or Latin, and obliged to wear yellow hats in the street. ([Location 5621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5621))
- Pius took little trouble to conceal his three natural children. ([Location 5644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5644))
- Not, on the other hand, for his own: he is the only pope between the mildly ridiculous Celestine V (1294–1296) and the wholly admirable Pius X (1903–1914) to have been made—unaccountably—a saint. ([Location 5692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5692))
- Gregory’s name is chiefly remembered today in the Gregorian calendar, which he introduced in a bull of 1582. ([Location 5699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5699))
- With Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox already at one another’s throats, it was at first adopted only by the states in the Roman obedience. Broadly speaking, the Protestants accepted the reform at various times during the eighteenth century—Great Britain and her American colonies in 1752—while Russia, Greece, and the Balkan States delayed until the twentieth. ([Location 5702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5702))
- When Gregory died, aged eighty-three, after a thirteen-year pontificate, he left the Papacy almost penniless, the Papal States faced with near anarchy. ([Location 5731](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5731))
- He fixed the maximum number of cardinals at seventy, at which it remained for the next four hundred years. ([Location 5754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5754))
- He it was, for example, who in 1616 first took issue with Galileo for his championship of the Copernican theory that the sun, rather than the earth, was the center of the universe. ([Location 5925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5925))
- queen—Elizabeth, the daughter of King James I of England—were to live the rest of their lives in exile. As for his kingdom, Bohemia, it was delivered into Habsburg—and therefore Catholic—hands, in which it was to remain for nearly three hundred years. ([Location 5960](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5960))
- a new Protestant protagonist, King Gustav II Adolf, better known as Gustavus Adolphus, of Sweden. ([Location 5971](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=5971))
- THE FIRST TWO of those three successors, Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi and Cardinal Emilio Altieri, both took the name of Clement. ([Location 6067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6067))
- His successor, Emilio Altieri, or Clement X, elected after a five-month conclave because France and Spain determinedly vetoed each other’s candidates, was already in his eightieth year and hopelessly ineffectual. ([Location 6087](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6087))
- For some years already the Jesuits had been growing increasingly unpopular. Founded in 1534 as a humble order of missionaries, they were now seen as a vast, intellectually arrogant, power-hungry, and hugely ambitious organization, enmeshed in international intrigue and totally unscrupulous in their operations. ([Location 6456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6456))
- Blaise Pascal in his Lettres provinciales had attacked them as shameless hypocrites. ([Location 6459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6459))
- CARDINAL GIOVANNI ANGELO Braschi, who was elected in February 1775 after a four-month conclave and took the name of Pius VI, was a genial aristocrat who had been engaged to be married before making a last-minute decision to enter the priesthood instead. His pontificate was to last nearly twenty-five years, at that time the longest in papal history; it was unfortunate indeed that for so fateful a quarter century the Church should have fallen into such feckless hands. ([Location 6667](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6667))
- The Holy Roman Empire, which had begun with Charlemagne just over a thousand years before, had been abolished in 1806; the great prince-bishoprics of Germany were gone. ([Location 6908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6908))
- As a first step in what would clearly prove a Herculean task, on August 7, 1814, Pius VII revived the Society of Jesus. ([Location 6912](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=6912))
- Born in 1807 in Nice, which would be ceded to France only in 1860, Garibaldi was, like Mazzini, a Piedmontese. He had begun his professional life ([Location 7091](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7091))
- The scenes of carnage made a deep impression on a young Swiss named Henri Dunant, who chanced to be present and organized emergency aid services for the wounded. Five years later, as a direct result of his experience, he was to found the Red Cross. ([Location 7193](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7193))
- Already three years before, his decree Non Expedit—which was to remain in force until after the First World War—had forbidden Catholics to stand or vote in elections, or in any way to take part in the political life of the new kingdom; ([Location 7354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7354))
- According to custom, Cardinal Pecci, the camerlengo—soon to succeed him as Leo XIII—tapped his forehead three times with a little silver hammer, calling him by his baptismal name, Giovanni Maria. ([Location 7374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7374))
- When there was no reply, he turned to the other cardinals present with the traditional words “The Pope is truly dead.” ([Location 7375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7375))
- It had been the longest pontificate—thirty-one years—in papal history. Politically it had been, from Pius’s point of view, a disaster; but Pius did not spend all his life trying to maintain his temporal power. ([Location 7378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7378))
- in December 1905 the Concordat of 1801 was formally abrogated, bringing about the complete separation of Church and state. ([Location 7482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7482))
- In the present industrial society, he wrote, “a small number of very rich men have been able to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a yoke which is very little better than slavery itself.… The conflict now raging derives from the vast expansion of industrial pursuits and the wondrous discoveries of science; from the changed relations between masters and workmen; from the enormous fortunes of some few individuals and the utter poverty of the masses; from the increased self-reliance and closer mutual combination of the working classes; and also, finally, from the prevailing moral degeneracy.” ([Location 7493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=7493))
- quite apart from the 1,340 men and women whom he beatified, the first step to sainthood, he canonized no fewer than 483 new saints, more than had been made in the previous five centuries. ([Location 8260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B004J4WKTC&location=8260))
