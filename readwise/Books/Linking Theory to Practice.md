## Highlights
- The job of the theory builder and some kinds of researchers (like Thompson) is to ignore the finer details of students’ lives. However, the student affairs professional’s job typically is not to ignore those details. ([Location 228](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0765ZNB4Y&location=228))
- Case-study analysis benefits student affairs administrators as well as students in professional programs in four ways: challenges conventional habits of administrative thought and action; promotes consideration of multiple perspectives; promotes consideration of unique campus environments; and manipulates problems with realistic legal, institutional, and political constraints. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0765ZNB4Y&location=239))
- Case-study analysis is an ideal way to begin to challenge and modify theories of action or, in the absence of theories of action, to cultivate positive ones. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0765ZNB4Y&location=248))

- protests and demands for college access by African Americans and Latina/os in the late 1960s and early 1970s, an outgrowth of civil rights activism that was happening within the larger community at the time.

- college consistently has low SAT scores and low graduation rates and as a result has been criticized by local news outlets. Proud of the access they provide to a wide range of students, faculty and staff are satisfied with the college’s practice of using a nonselective admissions process that traditionally admits more than 59% of its applicants.

- While average SAT scores have increased, faculty still complain that students are underprepared for college-level work. At a recent meeting to discuss the new admissions policy, one faculty member, Mike Staley, argued, “I don’t care what admissions says. My students still have trouble with writing. It’s too late for them once they are already in our classes.” ([Location 1819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0765ZNB4Y&location=1819))

- Although the administration intends to continue to serve the needs of the greater community, the number of students of color in this year’s incoming freshman class has dropped significantly. If indeed the institution wants to maintain its mission and obligations to the community, it is not clear why the institution raised the admissions standards to a level that, by national standards systematically reduces the eligibility of students of color. The editorial also noted that some institutions eliminated SAT exams as a standard for admission. ([Location 1838](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0765ZNB4Y&location=1838))
