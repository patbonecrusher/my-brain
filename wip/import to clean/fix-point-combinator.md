# Fixed-Point Combinators 
An introduction to *fixed-point combinators* and *lambda calculus* with *real-world JavaScript examples showing their power and beauty.

### TL;DR
* Lambda calculus can give you a deeper level of understanding of how functions work and how they relate.
* Fixed-point combinators can help you to implement recursion.
* Learning new stuff makes you stronger and better as a software engineer.
* Scroll to the bottom for practical applications.

### Fixed-Point Combinators
Fixed-point combinators are higher-order functions such that:

```
y f = f (y f)
```

for all f where y is a combinator, f is a function, and space is a function application. This expands as follows:

```javascript 
y f = f (y f)
    = f (f (y f))
    = f (f (f (y f)))
    = ...
```

This expansion is *recursion*.

With the use of combinators, we can define self-referencing anonymous functions avoiding the use of variables. Let’s see the most simple one!

### The U Combinator
The U combinator is the most simple fixed-point combinator.

```lambda calculus
U g := g g
U = λg.(g g)
```

where λg. is *lambda abstraction*, which is the definition of an anonymous function that takes an argument g and substitutes it into its expression.

#### Example in JavaScript
Define the U combinator in JavaScript ES6 with *arrow function*.

```javascript
U = g => g(g)
```

In practice we want our recursions to halt so we can calculate something. With *currying* we can introduce a halting condition.

Lets calculate factorial with the U combinator.

```javascript
fact = U(
  g => // g for self-referencing
    x => // currying is for passing the halting condition
      (x === 0) // halting condition
        ? 1 // halt
        : x * g(g)(x - 1) // recursion
)
fact(5) === 120 // true
```

### The Y Combinator in Lambda Calculus
*Haskell B. Curry* defined the Y combinator as follows.

```
Y := λf.(λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x))
```

The Y combinator could be used even in this form but we can simplify it.

Let’s do β-reduction.

```
Y g := (λf.(λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x))) g
     = (λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x))
     = g ((λx.g (x x)) (λx.g (x x)))
     = g (Y g)
```
     
The reduced form reveals that this is a fixed point combinator:

```
Y g = g (Y g)
Y = λg.(g (Y g))
```

#### The Y Combinator in JavaScript

![[15025061290328.jpg]]

The Y combinator works only in lazy languages such as Haskell. In non-lazy languages like JavaScript the intuitive implementation expands until *stack overflow* or never halts in case of *tail call optimization*.

```javascript
Y = g => g(Y(g)) // intuitive implementation
Y( a => a ) // call the Y combinator with the unit function
Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

Solution: let’s define *laziness* in JavaScript: wrap `Y(g)` in a zero-arity function.

```javascript
Y =
    g => g( () => Y(g) )
```

This way we can avoid automatic expansion. Let’s calculate factorial with `Y`.

```javascript
fact = Y(
  g => // g for self-referencing
    x => // this curryed function is returned by g()
      (x === 0) // halting condition
        ? 1 // halt
        : x * g()(x - 1) // recursion
)
fact(5) === 120 // true
```

The difference to the previous implementation is that there is no need to pass `g` to `g()`, it is already bound.

### The Z Combinator
#### The Z Combinator in Lambda Calculus

```lisp
Z := λg.(λx.g (λv.((x x) v))) (λx.g (λv.((x x) v)))
```

There is an extra `v` argument and an extra *function application* which is not present in the case of Y combinator definition.

After *β-reduction* we got:

```
Z g v = g (Z g) v
Z g = λ.v(g (Z g) v)
Z = λv.(λg.(g (Z g) v))
```

#### The Z Combinator in JavaScript
An extra `v` parameter and *function application* to the Y combinator gives us the Z combinator.

Because of the extra parameter v we do not need to construct a lazy recursion in JavaScript.

```javascript
Z =
    g => v => g(Z(g))(v)
```
    
Let’s define a function that sums up the numbers from a given whole number to an other one.

```
example series: 5 6 7 8
sum: 26
```

Define the sum function with the Z combinator:

```javascript
// sum(from, to)
sum = Z(
  g => // g for self-referencing
    from =>
      to =>
        (from === to) // halting condition
          ? to // halt
          : from + g(from + 1)(to) // step one and recurse
)
sum(5)(8) === 26 // true
```

We can see that there is no extra *laziness* implemented because the function application is lazy in itself.

#### The Connection Between U, Y and Z
Let us consider the JavaScript implementations.

```javascript
U = g => g(g) // recursion is strict, must curry
Y = g => g( () => Y(g) ) // we made the recursion 'lazy'
Z = g => v => g(Z(g))(v) // explicit currying makes it 'lazy'
```

### Practical Examples in JavaScript
Here are some real-world examples using fixed point combinators.

#### Accept Terms
We would like users to accept terms. Ask them until they accept it.

It can be done *without naming* a function for the recursion.

```javascript
Y(ask =>
  (prompt('Accept terms?') !== 'yes')
    ? ask()
    : alert('Thanks!')
)
```

We can even count how many times a user did not accept terms.

```javascript
Y(ask => count =>
  (prompt('Accept terms?') !== 'yes')
    ? ask()(count + 1)
    : alert('At last! It took ' + count + ' times.')
)(1)
```

We can notice that counting is done via currying.
You can read more on [Currying in JavaScript ES6](https://medium.com/@adambene/currying-in-javascript-es6-540d2ad09400).

#### Fetch Retry

We can retry unsuccessful fetch() or XHR operations with a maximum number of attempts with manual operation on the UI.

```javascript
Y(
  retry =>
    attempts =>
      fetch('/betcha-cant-load-this')
      .then(
        res => res.ok
          ? alert('Loaded!')
          : (
              (attempts > 1 && confirm('Reload?')) // retry on UI
                ? retry()(attempts - 1)
                : alert('Could not load. ' + res.status)
            )
      )
)(5)
```

### Conclusion

I really believe that lambda calculus and functional programming can help software engineers to organize their thoughts in a consistent and rigorous way that helps writing good quality code.
