## Atuin

Atuin replaces your shell history with an SQLite database and records additional context for your commands. With this context, Atuin gives you a faster and better search of your shell history!

Additionally, Atuin (optionally) syncs your shell history between your machines! Fully end-to-end encrypted, of course.

You may use either the server I host or host your own! Or don't use sync at all. As all history sync is encrypted, I couldn't access your data even if I wanted to. And IÂ don't want to.

### In .zshrc file
```zshrc
eval "$(atuin init zsh --disable-up-arrow)"
bindkey '^r' _atuin_search_widget

# depends on terminal mode
bindkey '^[[A' _atuin_search_widget
bindkey '^[OA' _atuin_search_widget
```
