# Les orgues Casavant

My 2nd cousin four times removed

```
Claver and Samuel Casavant, the sons of Joseph Casavant (1807-1874), the first organ builder born in Canada, visit landmark instruments and organ builders in France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and England. Upon their return to Saint-Hyacinthe in October 1879, they establish Casavant Fr√®res.
