# Sisters of the presentation of mary berlin NH history

By Barbara Tetreault

BERLIN — In 127 years of service to the community, hundreds of Sisters of the Presentation of Mary have lived and served in Berlin and Gorham. An era came to a close this week when the last two sisters moved out of Berlin.

Sister Anne Beausolueil and Sister Pauline Sauvageau were the last Catholic sisters left in the Berlin-Gorham area.

The decision was a sad one for the order said Sister Helene Cote, head of the Sisters of Presentation United States Province headquartered in Methuen, Mass.

“It breaks my heart but we have no one else to replace them,” said Cote, who taught in Berlin at one time.

Beausoleil actually moved to the order’s nursing home/retirement complex in Manchester earlier this fall because of ill health. Legally blind, Sauvageau remained behind to pack up the rectory and left Tuesday to retire to Manchester as well.

The parish bid farewell to the two sisters with a special mass at St. Anne Church Monday, fittingly enough on the annual celebration of the Presentation of Mary. The mass was followed by a special luncheon at St. Anne hall given in their honor.

"The Sisters of the Presentation of Mary were true friends to the local community Catholic and non-Catholic alike. I am sad to see their daily presence among us come to an end but it was never about them — it was always about Christ. They may not live among us, but Christ remains in the hearts of those they served. For this we can say their lives were fruitful and we are eternally grateful. They will be missed but not forgotten,” said Rev. Kyle Stanton, pastor of Good Shepherd Parish of Berlin and Holy Family Parish of Gorham.

Cote said her order’s basic vocation “is to educate the faithful” and that is what brought the sisters to the Berlin area.

Seven sisters of the Presentation of Mary ventured to the city in 1889 to open and direct St. Regis Academy, the first Catholic parochial school here. The school opened with an enrollment of 400. By 1910, the enrollment had grown to 2,000 students and a new three-and-a-half story school was built to accommodate the population.

Guardian Angel followed in 1918, St. Benedict in Cascade in 1926, St. Joseph in 1930, Notre Dame High School in 1941 and Our Lady of the Mountains Academy in Gorham in 1946. When all the schools were operating, Sauvageau said there were about 125 sisters from her order living in Berlin-Gorham. But as the population declined, so did enrollment. The last of the six schools closed in 1989.

There were nuns from other orders that worked in the city. The Sisters of Charity opened and operated St. Louis Hospital from 1905 to 1971. The Sisters of Mercy had a presence in the area until recently. But Sister Anne and Sister Pauline were the last two Catholic nuns left.

The two women both grew up in Woonsocket, R.I., but did not know each other until they met through the order.

Beausolueil took her final vows in 1957 at the age of 20. She taught in Rhode Island for a while but her health forced her to leave teaching. She served as a cook and then in various capacities in Rome including as a driver and tour guide for sisters visiting the General of Sisters there.

For Sauvageau, becoming a nun was a family tradition. Four of her father’s sisters were nuns and she said the sisterhood was a vocation for her. She took her final vows in 1952 at the age of 22 and in 1959 was assigned to Notre Dame High School in Berlin. Sauvageau said she loved her students and enjoyed teaching in Berlin but, in 1962, she was asked to serve as a missionary in the Philippines. She spent 11 years there, returning in 1973 to serve her hometown as well as care for her aging parents.

In 1974, Sauvageau and Beausolueil met and for 15 years during the summer jointly offered their fellow sisters a House of Prayer experience at the order’s summer house in Acton, Maine. After a sabbatical year, Sauvageau was asked to return to Berlin in 1994 as a pastoral associate and has remained here ever since. A few years later, Beausolueil joined her in Berlin.

One of their main focuses here has been the Marie Rivier Association, named after the founder of the Sisters of the Presentation of Mary. The apostolate has about 100 active members who meet monthly and are active in the parish.

When the city’s four parishes merged in 2000, the two sisters were asked to open a religious store at St. Anne Hall to replace the one lost in the consolidation. Beausoleil was the manager and it continues operating today with volunteers. Sauvageau said the two hope the store continues because it serves as a place for people to share joy and sorrow.

As pastoral associates, Sauvageau and Beausolueil did communion calls at the city’s two nursing homes, at the hospital, and for homebound parishioners for Holy Family Church in Gorham as well as Good Shepherd Parish. They also reorganized the Marie Rivier food pantry with the help of volunteers.

The sisters said the luncheon Monday was bittersweet as they said goodbye to friends and a place they had grown to love.

“It has always been a home for us — a very dear home,” said Sauvageau.

Both women said they found serving as sisters very rewarding and love the life they chose.

Cote acknowledged few women these days are interested in following in their footsteps.

“We don’t have a lot of women joining,” she said.

The number of nuns in the United States dropped from 180,000 in 1965 to about 50,000 in 2014 according to research from Georgetown University. Moreover, it is an aging population — a recent article in U.S. Catholic World Report said the median age of sisters in the United States is 72.

Cote said it is a different world and women have more opportunities to serve the church as laity than in the past. They do not have to take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience to play an active role in their faith.

Stanton said he has been working for two years to find replacements for the two sisters. He said he is hopeful but does not have a commitment yet from a different order.
