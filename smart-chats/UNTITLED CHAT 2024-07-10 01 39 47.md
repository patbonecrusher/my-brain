The note discusses the importance of understanding the concept of "cognitive load" in education, which refers to the amount of mental effort required to learn new information. It explains that when cognitive load is high, it can lead to decreased learning and understanding, and that effective teaching strategies should aim to reduce cognitive load by breaking down complex information into manageable chunks, providing clear explanations, and using visual aids. The note also mentions the role of prior knowledge in affecting cognitive load, and suggests that teachers can help reduce cognitive load by activating students' prior knowledge and scaffolding their learning. The note concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering cognitive load in the design of instructional materials and assessments.
