# Bluetooth keeps going to sleep after 5 seconds.

The keyboard goes to sleep after not being touched for 5 seconds, and it takes 2-3 seconds to wake it up.

The issue started after connecting a google cast speaker.

Solution:
Turn Bluetooth off for a few seconds, then turn it back on.  It seems to have fixed the issue.
